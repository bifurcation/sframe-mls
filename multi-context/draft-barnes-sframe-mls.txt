    Using Messaging Layer Security (MLS) to Provide Keys for SFrame
                     draft-barnes-sframe-mls-latest

Abstract

   Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real-
   time media.  In order for SFrame to address cases where media are
   exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it
   needs to be augmented with a group key management protocol.  The
   Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous group
   authenticated key exchange, allowing a group of participants in a
   media session to authenticate each other and agree on a group key.
   This document defines how the group keys produced by MLS can be used
   with SFrame to secure real-time sessions for groups.

1.  Introduction

   Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real-
   time media [I-D.omara-sframe].  In order for SFrame to address cases
   where media are exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time
   conferencing), it needs to be augmented with a group key management
   protocol.  The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] provides continuous group authenticated key
   exchange.  MLS provides several important security properties
   [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture]:

   *  Group Key Exchange: All members of the group at a given time know
      a secret key that is inaccessible to parties outside the group.

   *  Authentication of group members: Each member of the group can
      authenticate the other members of the group.

   *  Group Agreement: The members of the group all agree on the
      identities of the participants in the group.

   *  Forward Secrecy: There are protocol events such that if a member's
      state is compromised after the event, group secrets created before
      the event are safe.

   *  Post-compromise Security: There are protocol events such that if a
      member's state is compromised before the event, the group secrets
      created after the event are safe.

   When a real-time session uses MLS as the basis for SFrame keys, these
   security properties apply to real-time media as well.  In the
   remainder of this document, we define how to use the secrets produced
   by MLS to generate the keys required by SFrame.

2.  SFrame Parameter Negotiation

   In order to interoperate, the sender and receiver(s) of an SFrame
   payload need to agree on two parameters:

   *  The SFrame ciphersuite

   *  The number of bits "E" used to signal the epoch

   These parameters can be negotiated in MLS using the
   "sframe_parameters" extension.  An MLS participant advertises its
   supported ciphersuites in its KeyPackage.  The creator of the group
   chooses the values of these parameters for the group (possibly based
   on a set of KeyPackages) and advises them to new joiners in Welcome
   messages.

   ``` uint16 SFrameCipherSuite;

   struct { SFrameCipherSuite cipher_suites<0..255>; }
   SFrameCapabilities;

   struct { SFrameCipherSuite cipher_suite; uint8 epoch_bits; }
   SFrameParameters; ```

   The values allowed for "SFrameCipherSuite" are defined in
   [I-D.omara-sframe] and the IANA registries it references.

   When an extension of type "sframe_parameters" appears in an MLS
   KeyPackage, the extension data field MUST contain an
   SFrameCapabilities object.  When such an extension appears in a
   Welcome message, it MUST contain an SFrameParameters object.  The
   ciphersuite values MUST represent valid SFrame ciphersuites.

   The SFrameParameters object for a group, if present, MUST be included
   in the GroupContext for the group, as an extension of type
   "sframe_parameters".  This ensures that the members of the group
   agree on the SFrame parameters associated to the group.

2.1.  SFrame Parameter Selection

   Just as with MLS ciphersuite selection, the creator of an MLS group
   chooses the SFrame parameters to be used for the group.  The
   parameters are then fixed for the lifetime of the group.

   The creator of the group needs to choose a ciphersuite and an
   "epoch_bits" value.  The ciphersuite SHOULD be chosen from among
   those supported by the members of the group, as expressed by those
   members' key packages.  Members that don't support the chosen
   ciphersuite will not be able to send or receive SFrame-encrypted
   media.

   As discussed below, the "epoch_bits" field effectively bounds the
   rate at which the epoch can change, at the cost of possible growth in
   the KID field.  Applications SHOULD NOT use "epoch_bits = 0", unless
   they have an external signal for which epoch's keys are in use.
   Otherwise, applications should choose a value for "epoch_bits" such
   that they expect to never have more than "2^epoch_bits" epochs active
   at once.  That is, by the time the key for epoch "k + 2^epoch_bits"
   is distributed, all senders should have stopped sending with epoch
   "k".

3.  SFrame Key Management

   MLS creates a linear sequence of keys, each of which is shared among
   the members of a group at a given point in time.  When a member joins
   or leaves the group, a new key is produced that is known only to the
   augmented or reduced group.  Each step in the lifetime of the group
   is know as an "epoch", and each member of the group is assigned an
   "index" that is constant for the time they are in the group.

   In SFrame, we derive per-sender "base\_key" values from the group
   secret for an epoch, and use the KID field to signal the epoch and
   sender index.  First, we use the MLS exporter to compute a shared
   SFrame secret for the epoch.

   sframe_epoch_secret = MLS-Exporter("SFrame 10 MLS", "", AEAD.Nk)

   sender_base_key[index] = HKDF-Expand(sframe_epoch_secret,
                              encode_big_endian(index, 8), AEAD.Nk)

   [[ OPEN ISSUE: MLS has its own "secret tree" that provides better
   forward secrecy properties within an epoch.  (This scheme provides
   none.)  An alternative approach would be to re-use the MLS secret
   tree, either directly or as a data structure. ]]

   The Key ID (KID) field in the SFrame header provides the epoch and
   index values that are needed to generate the appropriate key from the
   MLS key schedule.

   KID = (sender_index << E) + (epoch % (1 << E))

   For compactness, do not send the whole epoch number.  Instead, we
   send only its low-order E bits.  The participants in the group MUST
   agree on the value of E for a given session, through some negotiation
   not specified here.

   Note that E effectively defines a re-ordering window, since no more
   than 2^E epoch can be active at a given time.  The better the
   participants are in sync with regard to key roll-over, and the less
   reordering of SFrame-protected payloads by the network, the fewer
   bits of epoch are necessary.

   Receivers MUST be prepared for the epoch counter to roll over,
   removing an old epoch when a new epoch with the same E lower bits is
   introduced.

   [[ OPEN ISSUE: There might be some considerations for new joiners.
   Some trial decryption might be necessary to detect whether you're in
   epoch N or in epoch N + 1 << E. ]]

   Once an SFrame stack has been provisioned with the
   "sframe_epoch_secret" for an epoch, it can compute the required KIDs
   and "sender_base_key" values on demand, as it needs to encrypt/
   decrypt for a given member.

           ...
            |
   Epoch 17 +--+-- index=33 -> KID = 0x211
            |  |
            |  +-- index=51 -> KID = 0x331
            |
            |
   Epoch 16 +--+-- index=2 --> KID = 0x20
            |
            |
   Epoch 15 +--+-- index=3 --> KID = 0x3f
            |  |
            |  +-- index=5 --> KID = 0x5f
            |
            |
   Epoch 14 +--+-- index=3 --> KID = 0x3e
            |  |
            |  +-- index=7 --> KID = 0x7e
            |  |
            |  +-- index=20 -> KID = 0x14e
            |
           ...

   MLS also provides an authenticated signing key pair for each
   participant.  When SFrame uses signatures, these are the keys used to
   generate SFrame signatures.

3.1.  Multiple Sender Contexts

   Real-time media systems often have strong decoupling between media
   sources after initial setup, including things like providing separate
   SRTP contexts for different media sources.  In SRTP, this is safe
   because the RTP SSRC is included in the nonce computation.  With the
   system defined here, however, the key and nonce only depend on the
   secret and the sender ID in the KID, so having multiple contexts with
   the same secret and KID leads to nonce reuse.

   In order to support this situation, a sender MAY choose to use the
   high-order bits of the KID field to provide an additional context
   distinguisher.  These bits will be interpreted as part of the sender
   index by receivers, so different keys and independent nonce streams
   will be derived per context.

   A sender sending context IDs in this way MUST reserve S bits for the
   sender ID, such that any sender index in the group can be expressed
   in S bits.  That is, it MUST be the case that:

   "group_size - 1 < (1 << S)"

   Thus, for a group of a given size, the sender may use up to 64 - S -
   E bits of the KID field to provide additional context, at the expense
   of having to transmit a longer KID field.  The resulting KID value
   has the following form:

   "S bits E bits <------> <------>
   +--------+------------+--------+-------+ | 000... | Context ID |
   Index | Epoch | +--------+------------+--------+-------+"

4.  Security Considerations

   The security properties provided by MLS are discussed in detail in
   [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture] and [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].  This
   document extends those guarantees to SFrame.

   It should be noted that the per-sender keys derived here do not
   provide per-sender authentication, since any member of the group
   could derive the same keys (as indeed they must in order to decrypt
   the protected payload).  Per-sender keys are derived only to avoid
   nonce collision among multiple unsynchronized senders.  So the
   authentication limitations of SFrame remain: There is per-sender
   authentication only when signatures are used.  Otherwise, SFrame only
   authenticates membership in the group, and members are free to
   impersonate each other.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA add an entry to the MLS Extension
   Types registry, with the following values:

   +=======+===================+============+=============+===========+
   | Value | Name              | Message(s) | Recommended | Reference |
   +=======+===================+============+=============+===========+
   | TBD   | sframe_parameters | KP, GI     | Y           | RFC XXXX  |
   +-------+-------------------+------------+-------------+-----------+

                                 Table 1

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document.
